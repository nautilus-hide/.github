Nautilus Hide is a simple Python extension for the Nautilus file manager that adds options to the right-click menu to hide or unhide files.

The extension hides the files without renaming them (i.e. without prefixing a dot (.) or suffixing a tilde (~)). It does that by adding their names to the folder's ".hidden" file, which Nautilus reads to hide the listed files the next time you open or refresh the folder.
